            <p>During my tenure as a Junior Data Analyst Intern at PrepInsta, I had the opportunity to gain valuable hands-on experience in the field of data analysis while contributing to the organization's data-driven decision-making processes. My primary responsibilities revolved around leveraging analytical tools such as Tableau and Power BI to extract actionable insights from complex datasets and present them in the form of interactive and visually appealing dashboards.</p>

            <p>In this project, I developed a real-time Stock Market Price Predictor utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to forecast stock prices accurately. The primary objective was to provide investors with valuable insights into future stock movements, enabling them to make informed decisions for trading or investment purposes.</p>

            <p>The "Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning" project aimed to address the challenge of optimizing crop selection for farmers based on various environmental and soil conditions. Leveraging real-time dataset and employing Python along with machine learning techniques, we developed an advanced algorithm capable of recommending the most suitable crops with an impressive accuracy rate of 99% based on key features like rainfall, pH, moisture, soil density and weather conditions.</p>

            <h3>Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p><img src="https://machinemantra.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/heart-disease.png" style="height: 200px;"></p>
            <p>My passion for healthcare led me to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease with impressive accuracy (85.12% on training and 81.97% on test data). But I didn't stop there. I delved into the data, uncovering key factors influencing the model's predictions and exploring ways to improve generalizability across diverse demographics. I even investigated the model's "thought process" to ensure transparency and identify potential biases. By comparing my model to existing methods, I identified areas for further refinement, ensuring it remains at the forefront of heart disease prediction technology.</p>
